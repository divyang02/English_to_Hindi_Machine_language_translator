# Neural Machine Learning with Attention - Abstract

Neural machine translation (NMT) is an approach to machine translation that uses a large artificial neural network to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words, typically modeling entire sentences in a single integrated model.
Deep neural machine translation is an extension of neural machine translation. Both use a large neural network with the difference that deep neural machine translation processes multiple neural network layers instead of just one.
NMT models use deep learning and representation learning.
The word sequence modeling was at first typically done using a recurrent neural network (RNN). A bidirectional recurrent neural network, known as an encoder, is used by the neural network to encode a source sentence for a second RNN, known as a decoder, that is used to predict words in the target language.
